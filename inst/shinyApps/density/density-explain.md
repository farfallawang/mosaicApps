THIS TO BE MOVED TO THE "EXPLAIN" TAB

Density plots provide a "smooth" estimate of an empirical probability distribution, that is, a distribution defined by a data sample.  This app lets you generate a sample from any of several distributions and display both the individual data points and the smooth density distribution.

THIS NEEDS UPDATING

The user may specify the bandwidth (amount of smoothing) on density plot
using the bandwidth slider. Transformations may be performed on the data
using the transformation picker. These transformations include log, square
root, rank, and inverse cosine. If data is null, three more options are
available from the manipulate box. The distribution picker allows the user
to choose the type of distribution for random data to be created from. The
random seed slider picks the random seed. Number of points chooses the
number of points to be generated as data.
