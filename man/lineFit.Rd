\usage{
lineFit(display = c("normal", "showcase"))
}
\description{
An interactive demonstration program for showing how the residuals
and the sum of square residuals relates to the slope and intercept of a fitted
line.  There are sliders to modify the slope and intercept of the fitted
line and checkboxes that control whether to display the residuals (as lines)
or the sum of square residuals (as filled boxes).  The numerical value
of the sum of square residuals is always shown.  By modifying the slope and intercept,
you can see how the sum of square residuals increases compared to the
optimal, least squares value.
